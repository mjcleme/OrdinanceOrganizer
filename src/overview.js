 * ## Overview
 *
 * ### Goal
 *
 * The goal of this SDK is to make the FamilySearch REST endpoints easier to consume.
 * Each SDK function wraps a corresponding REST endpoint and adds *convenience functions*
 * to make navigating the response easier.
 * In addition to the convenience functions you also have access to the original response,
 * so you always have the option of navigating the response elements yourself.
 * And you can make calls not anticipated by the SDK using the *plumbing functions* described below.
 *
 * ### Features
 *
 * - Authentication can be performed with a single function call, or even automatically.
 * - The access token can be saved in a cookie and can be expired automatically.
 * - REST endpoints can be called using simple function calls that set the correct request headers and request the correct URL.
 * - GET's are automatically retried to handle transient errors.
 * - Throttling is handled - calls are automatically retried.
 * - Responses are mapped to objects or arrays of objects that have convenience functions
 * to make extracting data from the responses easier.
 * - The response object prototypes can be extended with additional functions to navigate the response json and return
 * whatever custom information is desired.
 * - The SDK works using jQuery, AngularJS, or Node.js; no other dependencies are required.
 *

 * ## Getting started
 *
 * Download the SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/rootsdev/familysearch-javascript-sdk)
 * (see the README file for more information).
 *
 * ### Browser
 *
 * 1. Create an instance of the SDK. Read more about {@link familysearch.types:constructor.FamilySearch all available options}.
 * <pre>
 * var client = new FamilySearch({
 *   client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE',
 *   environment: 'sandbox',
 *   // redirect_uri is the URI you registered with FamilySearch.
 *   // The page does not need to exist. The URI only needs to have
 *   // the same host and port as the server running your script.
 *   // (If you want your app to work on Mobile Safari, the page does need to exist.
 *   //  see the "Authentication with Mobile Safari" section below for more information.)
 *   redirect_uri: 'REDIRECT_URI_GOES_HERE',
 *   http_function: jQuery.ajax,
 *   deferred_function: jQuery.Deferred
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * 2. Get an access token
 * <pre>
 * client.getAccessToken().then(function(response) {
 *    // now you have an access token
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * 3. Make API calls
 * <pre>
 * client.getCurrentUser().then(function(response) {
 *    // now you have the response
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * #### Example
 *
 * <pre>
 * var client = new FamilySearch({
 *   client_id: 'MY_CLIENT_ID',
 *   environment: 'sandbox',
 *   redirect_uri: 'http://localhost/auth',
 *   http_function: $.ajax,
 *   deferred_function: $.Deferred,
 * });
 *
 * client.getAccessToken().then(function(accessToken) {
 *   client.getCurrentUser().then(function(response) {
 *     var user = response.getUser();
 *     console.log('Hello '+user.contactName);
 *   });
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * ### Node.js
 *
 * In node, we depend on the [request](https://github.com/request/request) for http and [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) for promises.
 * These libraries are not loaded automatically; you need to add `require` them yourself.
 * 
 * 1. Add the sdk to your package.json file.
 * The SDK isn't published in npm yet. For now you'll have to point directly to the
 * repository from your package.json file. We ___strongly___ recommend using a tag (hash)
 * to point to a particular version. Without the hash you'll be pointing to master and
 * may catch the code in an unstable mid-release state.
 * <pre>
 * "familysearch-javascript-sdk": "https://github.com/rootsdev/familysearch-javascript-sdk.git#v0.9.15"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 2. Require the necessary modules:
 * <pre>
 * var FS = require('familysearch-javascript-sdk'),
 *     request = require('request'),
 *     q = require('q');
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 3. Create an instance of the SDK. Read more about {@link familysearch.types:constructor.FamilySearch all available options}.
 * <pre>
 * var client = new FamilySearch({
 *   client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE',
 *   environment: 'sandbox',
 *   access_token: 'SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN',
 *   http_function: request,
 *   deferred_function: q.defer
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * 4. Make API calls
 * <pre>
 * client.getCurrentUser().then(function(response) {
 *    // now you have the response
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * #### Example
 *
 * <pre>
 * var client = new FamilySearch({
 *   client_id: 'MY_CLIENT_ID',
 *   environment: 'sandbox',
 *   access_token: 'SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN',
 *   http_function: require('request'),
 *   deferred_function: require('q').defer
 * });
 *
 * client.getCurrentUser().then(function(response) {
 *   var user = response.getUser();
 *   console.log('Hello '+user.contactName);
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * ## SDK Functions return promises
 *
 * As illustrated by the example above, most SDK functions return *promises*.
 * Promises are a great way to manage asynchronous code.
 * A promise has a `then(success callback, optional error callback)` method into which you pass your
 * *callback functions*.
 * Your *success callback function* is called once the promise has been fulfilled;
 * your *error callback function* is called if the project gets rejected.
 * For more information about promises, see for example [the jQuery deferred.then() documentation](http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/).
 *
 * Promises returned by the SDK are generated by the `deferred_function` you passed into the `init` call.
 * If the promise is fulfilled, it will call your success callback function with a single parameter containing the response data.
 * If the response is rejected, it will call your error callback function with whatever the `http_function` passed into the `init`
 * call would call it with.
 *
 * The following functions are also available on the promise
 *
 * - `getResponseHeader(header)`
 * - `getAllResponseHeaders()`
 * - `getStatusCode()`
 * - `getRequest()`
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * #### jQuery
 *
 * Requires jQuery 1.8 or later.
 *
 * If you pass `jQuery.ajax` and `jQuery.Deferred` into the `FamilySearch.init` call, the returned promises
 * will have the the methods [described here](http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise); for example
 *
 * - `then(function(response) {}, function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {})`
 * - `done(function(response) {})`
 * - `fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {})`
 *
 * #### AngularJS
 *
 * If you pass `$http` and `$q.defer` into the `FamilySearch.init` call, the returned promises
 * will have the methods [described here](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$q#description_the-promise-api); for example
 *
 * - `then(function(response) {}, function({data: response, status: status, headers: headers, config: config}) {})`
 * - `catch(function({data: response, status: status, headers: headers, config: config}) {})`
 *
 * #### Node.js
 *
 * When using `q.defer`, the returned promises will have the methods [described here](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promise-methods); for example
 * 
 * - `then(function(response){}, function(){})`
 * - `catch(function(){})`
 * - `progress(function(){})`
 * - `finally(function(){})`
 * - `done(function(){}, function(){}, function(){})`
 *
 * ## Handling responses
 *
 * SDK function responses are typically json objects.
 * The SDK function calls add *convenience functions* for returning various objects from the response.
 * For example, the `getPerson('ID')` call adds a `response.getPerson()` convenience function that returns the
 * {@link person.types:constructor.Person Person} object from the response.
 *
 * The returned objects contain the same properties as the original response json, but they have custom constructors whose
 * prototypes add convenience functions.
 * For example, the prototype for {@link person.types:constructor.Person Person} objects includes `$getGivenName()` and `$getSurname()`
 * convenience functions for returning the person's given name and surname respectively.
 * Without these convenience functions, you would have to navigate the `parts` elements of the `nameForms` array,
 * look for a part whose `type` element is `http://gedcomx.org/Given` or `http://gedcomx.org/Surname` respectively, and
 * then return the `value` element of that part.  `$getGivenName()` and `$getSurname()` do this for you.
 * All convenience functions added by the SDK begin with a `$` to avoid name conflicts with FamilySearch property names.
 * The object properties and convenience functions are fully described in the docs.
 *
 * You can add your own convenience functions to the returned objects.
 * For example, suppose you wanted to display someone's name followed by their id. You could write
 * <pre>
 *   FamilySearch.Person.prototype._getNameAndId = function() {
 *     return this.$getDisplayName() + ' (' + this.id + ')';
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * and from then on you could call `person._getNameAndId()` on any {@link person.types:constructor.Person Person} object.
 *
 * <pre>
 * FamilySearch.getPerson('ID').then(function(response) {
 *   var person = response.getPerson();
 *   console.log('Hello '+person._getNameAndId());
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * To avoid name conflicts with FamilySearch property names and SDK convenience functions, we recommend that you begin
 * your prototype functions and any properties you add to objects with a `_`.
 *
 * You are free to begin your prototype functions and object properties however you want; however, properties
 * beginning with a `_` are retained when an object is updated and the refresh parameter is set to true.
 * Also, object properties beginning with `$` or `_` are removed before posting data to FamilySearch.
 *
 * ## Updates
 *
 * All updateable objects have a constructor that takes a parameters object for initialization,
 * one or more *$set...()* functions, *$save()*, and *$delete()* functions.
 * To create a new object, call the constructor to create a new object and call *$save()*.
 * To update an object, call the *$set...()* functions or update properties and call *$save()*.
 * To delete an object, call *$delete()*.
 *
 * Most *$save()* functions take a *refresh* parameter that causes the object to be re-read from the server after it is saved.
 * This is useful when the server adds new fields to the object or modifies fields when saving it.
 * Many *$save()* and *$delete()* functions also take a *changeMessage* parameter to record the reason for the change.
 *
 * ## Creating New Objects
 *
 * When you want to create a new object, do not use the class's constructor directly. 
 * Each class has function which should be used instead. This allows us to maintain
 * a reference to the SDK client in each object (so that you don't have to).
 *
 * <pre>
 * var person = client.createPerson({ person data });
 * </pre>
 *
 * For each class, the structure of the data it expects matches what the API uses,
 * as [documented here](https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/api/media-types).
 * Occassionally we support simplified attributes, prefixed with a `$`, for common
 * bits of data so that you don't have to nest them in objects and arrays. The
 * following two examples are equivalent:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * var name = client.createName({
 *  "attribution" : {
 *    "changeMessage" : "change message"
 *  },
 *  "type" : "http://gedcomx.org/BirthName",
 *  "nameForms" : [ {
 *    "fullText" : "Anastasia Aleksandrova",
 *    "parts" : [ {
 *      "type" : "http://gedcomx.org/Given",
 *      "value" : "Anastasia"
 *    }, {
 *      "type" : "http://gedcomx.org/Surname",
 *      "value" : "Aleksandrova"
 *    } ]
 *  } ]
 * });
 *
 * var name = client.createName({
 *  "$changeMessage" : "change message",
 *  // type doesn't have a shortcut because it's
 *  // already simple and top-level
 *  "type" : "http://gedcomx.org/BirthName",
 *  "$fullText" : "Anastasia Aleksandrova",
 *  "$givenName": "Anastasia"
 *  "$surname": "Aleksandrova"
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * The constructors for each class document whether any simplified attributes are supported.
 *
 * Often, the simplified attributes are just shortcuts to a corresponding setter function.
 * Therefore, this example is equivalent to the two above:
 *
 * <pre>
 * var name = client.createName()
 *   .$setChangeMessage("change message")
 *   .$setType("http://gedcomx.org/BirthName")
 *   .$setFullText("Anastasia Aleksandrova")
 *   .$setGivenName("Anastasia")
 *   .$setSurname("Aleksandrova");
 * </pre>
 *
 * ## Authentication with Mobile Safari
 *
 * Mobile Safari opens the authentication popup window in a new tab and doesn't run javascript in background tabs.
 * Therefore, to run your app on Mobile Safari the redirect_uri URL must point to an HTML page containing the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <!DOCTYPE html>
 * <html><body>
 * <script>
 *   window.opener.FamilySearchOauthReceiver(window.location.href);
 *   window.close();
 * </script>
 * </body></html>
 * </pre>
 *
 * ## Using the SDK with module loaders
 *
 * The SDK can be used
 *
 * - as a browser global (i.e., referring to it as `window.FamilySearch` or just `FamilySearch`),
 * - with AMD loaders like *RequireJS* ([see the jQuery.html example](https://github.com/rootsdev/familysearch-javascript-sdk/blob/master/examples/jquery.html)),
 * - or with CommonJS loaders like *Node.js*.
 *
 * ## Plumbing functions
 *
 * The functions in the *plumbing* module are low-level functions that you would not normally call.
 * The higher-level API functions that you normally call are built on top of the plumbing functions.
 * The plumbing functions are exposed in case you want to do something not anticipated by the API functions.
 * Promises returned by plumbing functions call their callback functions with whatever the `http_function`
 * passed into the `init` call would call them with.
 * The plumbing functions serve the same purpose as the
 * [plumbing functions in git](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/#_low_level_commands_plumbing).
 *
 * ## Contributing
 *
 * **Pull requests are welcome!**
 *
 * **Grunt** We use grunt as our build tool.  Grunt has targets to run jshint, unit tests, generate the HTML documentation,
 * and combine and minify the javascript source files.
 *
 * **JSHint** We use a fairly strict .jshintrc file. JSHint is a great way to catch potential bugs before they occur.
 * Please use grunt to run jshint over your files before submitting pull requests.
 *
 * **Unit tests** are created by copying and pasting the sample json responses provided on the FamilySearch
 * developers website into files in the test/mock directory, then calling the corresponding function and running various
 * expectations over the results.
 * A test mock directs the function call to read the response from the corresponding json file instead of calling the
 * actual FamilySearch REST API.
 * Your pull requests should contain unit tests for new functionality and make sure that existing unit tests all pass.
 *
 * **Documentation** is generated from JSDoc comments that have been extended with some *ngdoc* keywords.
 * Take a look at the existing code for examples.
 * Your pull requests should be documented.
 *
 * **Travis-CI** Whenever a push is made to github, Travis-CI calls grunt to run jshint, unit tests, generate the HTML
 * documentation, combine and minify the javascript source files, and publish the documentation and combined & minified
 * source to the gh-pages branch on github.
